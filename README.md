# what-i-learned-in-week-6
It's *only* been 7 weeks!
___


Loops: These statements are used to run a repeated code until it meets a certain condition. Ex. 'Run a loop that adds one to the previous number until the number 10 is reached.' 
    - We also learned how to write a loop via a 'for' statement which includes the condition and change. 

Arrays: There seems to be an advantage to using arrays when you want to store the same kind of data type in a variable. However, after seeing some examples, it looks like you can also have different data types stored. We also learned that you are able to add & delete data into the array without having to rewrite the statement itself. 
  

 

   

**Thoughts**
1. Need to pay more specific attention to the placement of the curly brackets. Didn't give much thought to them before aside from making sure the pairs matched up. 
2. Words of the Week: funky
3. Struggling with functions in general, but trying to see if 'breaking them down' in parts will help me understand it.
